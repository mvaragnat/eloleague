## 2025-10-03

- Add new game system: Epic UK
  - Seeded from `config/game_systems.yml` with factions sourced from Epic UK official army lists.
  - Factions are English-only per requirement (no FR translations).
  - Docs updated in `context.md`. Tests adjusted for new counts.

## 2025-10-02

- Tournament slug URLs
  - All tournaments now have a URL-friendly slug based on their title (generated at creation)
- Slugs normalize names: convert to lowercase, replace spaces and hyphens with underscores, remove special characters, replace accents with similar non-accented letters
  - Tournament URLs now use slugs instead of database IDs for better SEO and readability (e.g., `/tournaments/spring-championship-2025`)
  - Backward compatibility maintained: tournaments can still be accessed by ID
  - Slug is immutable after creation; changing the tournament name does not update the slug
  - Admin form displays a warning notice when editing tournament names
  - Rake task added to backfill slugs for existing tournaments without slugs
  - Full test coverage and localization (EN/FR)

## 2025-10-03

- Avo admin: add search by username on Users resource index.

## 2025-10-01

- Swiss tournaments: Added "Score for bye" option
  - Organizers can set a score value (default 0) that bye players receive in their score_sum
  - Configurable in Admin tab (Swiss tournaments only)
  - Displayed in tournament Settings/Overview tab
  - Previously, byes awarded 1.0 points but 0 score, causing ranking issues when using score as primary criterion
  - Now organizers can set an appropriate bye score (e.g., match the average game score) for fair rankings

## [Unreleased] - 2025-09-29

- Avo admin dashboard updates:
  - Game Factions: added filter by Game System, sortable Name column, and a Games Played column showing number of participations per faction.
  - Game Factions: added bulk delete action to remove multiple selected factions in one click (with confirmation and EN/FR i18n).
  - New users created by admins now auto-generate a secure random password if left blank (fixes "password can't be blank").
  - Usernames are displayed across Tournament Matches, Registrations, Elo Ratings, and Elo Changes via proper belongs_to association titles.
  - Removed separate sidebar entries for Game Participation and Tournament Rounds in Avo.
  - Game Events display a participants summary with usernames and scores.

## 2025-09-18

- Tournament: organizers can edit reported matches
  - Editing updates the existing Game::Event (no new Elo application)
  - Swiss: existing generated next-round pairings remain unchanged
  - Elimination: parent assignment updates only if the next match has not been played

- Feature — Organizer can swap pairings for unplayed matches in Swiss and Elimination:
  - On the match page, the A/B player names become admin-only dropdowns listing eligible players from the same round/depth with pending matches.
  - Selecting a player and clicking "Switch" swaps players across the two affected matches.
  - Backend validation ensures swaps only occur within the same round (Swiss) or same depth level (Elimination), and only for matches without results.
  - Fully localized (EN/FR), with controller tests for both formats.


## 2025-09-10

- Admin tab layout refined on tournament page:
  - Grouped action buttons into an "Actions" card.

## 2025-09-02

- 2025-09-04: Refactor New Game and Tournament Match forms to share participation fields partial; ensure New Game supports two-player entry and submission; add system test for dashboard game creation.

- Feature — Tournament admin can toggle participant status (pending/checked-in) directly from the Participants tab, regardless of participant requirements (faction or army list). Tab state is now persisted in the URL via `?tab=` and preserved on redirects/updates, so you return to the same tab after actions. Localized labels added.
- Feature — Open tournaments: when organizer clicks "Add game", they can now select Player A and Player B from participants. If the organizer is also registered, they are preselected as Player A by default (can be removed). Form uses Stimulus to select two players, validates factions and scores for both, and populates factions dynamically.

- Feature — Admin tab now includes a Description editor available to the organizer for all tournament formats. Updates auto-save on blur via Stimulus and reflect immediately in the Overview tab. Localized EN/FR.

- 2025-09-05: Feature — Non-competitive tournaments. Organizer can toggle a tournament as non-competitive (default off). When enabled, tournament games do not affect ELO.
